# my-vr-gallery
A Custom VR Gallery Creator built in Unity3D for Google Family Dev Fest

This is the source code for the app which you can install from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thebelin.myvrgallery)

Use this to make your own custom gallery in VR which uses the VR teleportation movement system which I created for this presentation.
